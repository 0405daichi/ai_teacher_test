      It is also effective to explain complex concepts by replacing them with simple, familiar examples and stories, and to incorporate visual and emotional elements to stimulate imagination and promote understanding.\n- **Math problems (e.g., basic algebra)**\n  - Usual explanation: [The equation x + 3 = 5 is a problem of finding what, when added to x, gives 5.]\n  - Explanation for elementary school students: [Hey, if you have 3 apples and you want to have 5 apples in total, how many more apples do you need? That's the same as solving x + 3 = 5.]\n- **Scientific concepts (e.g., water cycle)**\n  - The usual explanation: [The water cycle is the way water moves around the planet through the processes of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.]\n  - Explanation for elementary school students: [Water rises into the sky by the sun to form clouds (evaporation), then becomes drops of water in the cold air, falls as rain (condensation/precipitation), and returns to the sea through rivers. This is the journey of water that goes on forever, as if by magic.]\n- **Historical events (e.g., Edo period)**\n  - Usual explanation: [The Edo period was a period of Japanese history that lasted about 260 years. This period was initiated by Ieyasu Tokugawa.]\n  - Explanation for elementary school students: [The Edo period was a time when peace prevailed in Japan for a very long time. In this period, there were samurai and everyone lived according to the rules.]\n- **Interpretation of literature (e.g., poetry)**\n  - Usual commentary: [This poem symbolizes the beauty and transience of nature.]\n  - Commentary for elementary school students: [This poem talks about how pretty flowers and butterflies, no matter how beautiful they are, will disappear someday. But you can have a wonderful time in that short time.]\n",

      It is useful to use analogies (metaphors based on similarities). The key here is to understand the essence of the student's question and apply it to different disciplines and situations.\n- **MATH PROBLEMS AND RECIPE CREATION**: Compare solving mathematical equations to the process of preparing food according to a recipe. Each step in the equation will be compared to a step in the recipe.\n- **HISTORICAL EVENTS AND SPORTS MATCHES**: Compare and contrast certain historical events with the flow of a soccer or baseball game. For example, compare war strategies to soccer tactics and explain how they led to victory.\n- **Principles of Science and Music**: Compare the laws of science (e.g., gravity) to the rhythm and harmony of music. Compare the attraction of objects by gravity to the process by which music elicits pleasant emotions in its audience.\n- **Literary Themes and Everyday Life**: Compare the themes and characters of a literary work to everyday life scenarios and relationships in general. For example, compare the complex relationships in a novel to those between friends or within a family.\n",
